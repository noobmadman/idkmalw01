Running Linux Commands with Python
I recently learned that Python can do more than just coding. With the os module, I found out that I can use Python to run Linux commands. It's pretty handyâ€”you can do stuff like making directories, changing file permissions, and even formatting disks. Plus, it's all done within Python scripts, so you don't have to switch between different tools. It's been a game-changer for me, making tasks like managing files and doing system stuff a lot easier. 
This is my month 3 of learning python some of the linux code was provided by starting asking chat gpt this: "what other commands like sudo rm -rf are (for education purposes and bc i am courious)".
i know i know this "malware" is not big deal but thats what i can make.

Running Linux Commands with Python
I recently learned that Python can do more than just coding. With the os module, I found out that I can use Python to run Linux commands. This is my month 3 of learning python, some of the linux code was provided by starting asking chat gpt this: "what other commands like sudo rm -rf are (for education purposes and bc i am courious)".

I know I know this "malware" is not big deal but thats what I can make.

DO NOT RUN THIS----DO NOT RUN THIS----DO NOT RUN THIS, ONLY IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR FILES----DO NOT RUN THIS----DO NOT RUN THIS.

(THE CODE IS IN THE "main.py" FILE)
